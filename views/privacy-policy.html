Our primary goal is to provide you with exceptional service, and we understand that you may have questions or concerns regarding your personal information and how it will be used. To make this privacy policy easy to find, we make it available from home page of our website at www.sendwyre.com (the "website") and through our mobile applications. You may also email us with any privacy-related questions you have to <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="c4a8a1a3a5a884b7a1aaa0b3bdb6a1eaa7aba9">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></p>
				<h3>Applicability of Privacy Policy</h3>
				<p>This privacy policy applies to all information we collect though our web and mobile applications from Wyre users and merchants, including you. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Wyre does not own or control, or to individuals that Wyre does not employ or manage.</p>
				<p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person or company and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>
				<h3>The Information we Collect</h3>
				<p>When you visit the website or use one of our mobile applications, we collect your IP address, and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. We also may collect certain geo-location information. If you do not agree to our collection of this information, you may not be able to use our Service.<br>If you open an account, we collect the following information from you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Account Information</strong> – text-enabled cellular/wireless telephone number, machine or mobile device ID and other similar information.</li>
					<li><strong>Identification Information</strong> – your name, street address, email address, date of birth, and SSN (or other governmental issued 	verification numbers).</li>
					<li><strong>Device Information</strong> – We also may obtain information about you: (a) from your mobile device such as your device type, machine or 	mobile device identification number, geo-location, time zone, language setting, browser type, and IP address, and (b) from third parties for purposes of transaction processing, identity verification, fraud detection or prevention and other similar purposes. For fraud prevention purposes, we also may link your machine ID with the machines of others who use your same payment cards.</li>
					<li><strong>Social Web Information</strong> – including but not limited to your Facebook connect credentials and email account information. If you 	authorize Facebook Connect, the plug in allows us access to your friends' contact information. Social and e-mail contact information 	helps you connect to friends and contacts for invitation and payment transmission purposes (as well as helping us improve our services and fight fraud).</li>
					<li><strong>Financial Information</strong> – bank account and routing numbers and credit cards linked to your Wyre account. Wyre does not share financial information with third party social networking services such as those listed in the prior paragraph.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We are committed to providing a safe, secure and all around great service. Therefore, before permitting you to use our service, we may require additional information from you we can use to verify your identity, address or other information or to manage risk and compliance throughout our relationship. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification, fraud prevention and similar services.</p>
				<p>When you are using our Service, we collect information about your account transactions and trust relationships and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention and other similar purposes.</p>
				<p>Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.</p>
				<h3>How we use Cookies</h3>
				<p>When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer. For example, we send a "session cookie" to your computer any time you log in to your Wyre account. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to ask you for your password on each page.</p>
				<p>Users are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website.</p>
				<h3>How we Protect and Store Personal Information</h3>
				<p>We store and process your personal information using third party servers located in secure data centers in the United States, This information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We also use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our office and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</p>
				<p>We make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that personal information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of our administrative, managerial and technical safeguards. Therefore, we urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your personal data as well, including never sharing your password with anyone.</p>
				<p>If Wyre learns of a systems security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using our services, you agree that Wyre may communicate with you electronically. Wyre may post a notice on the Website if a security breach occurs. Wyre may also send you an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice of a security breach) you should notify us.</p>
				<h3>How we use the Personal Information we Collect</h3>
				<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, fun and customized experience.</p>
				<p>We may use your personal information to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>provide the services and customer support you request;</li>
					<li>process transactions and send notices about your transactions or your network activity;</li>
					<li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
					<li>prevent potentially fraudulent, prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;</li>

					<li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, when we need to do so to comply with law we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement, or as otherwise required by law</li>
					<li>Third party service providers who assist us in providing services to you or who provide fraud detection or similar services on our [or any vendor's] behalf</li>
					<li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so</li>

				<p>Wyre is always improving, and as our service evolves we may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we modify this privacy policy, we will post the revised privacy policy to the website, and we will also revise the "last updated date" stated above. If we make material changes in the way we use personal information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our service or by sending you an e-mail.
