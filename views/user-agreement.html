If any of this information changes, it is your obligation to update such information as soon as possible. From time to time, we may also require you to provide further information as a condition for continued use of the Services to confirm your identity and the purpose of using our Services. <br /> <br />You shall provide us with true information, including but not limited to name, resident country, unique user ID, passport, incorporation documents, tax identification number, and other information and/or document which are deemed necessary for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing check.

We reserve the right to maintain your account registration information after you close your account for business and regulatory compliance purposes. <br /> <br />From time to time, we may be required to request further information regarding your transactions in order to comply with federal and state law. Failure to provide such information in a timely fashion may result in the suspension of your ability to transact until you provide such information or the closure of your Wyre Account. <br /> <br />You acknowledge and agree that we may make any inquiries that we consider necessary, either directly or through third parties, concerning your identity and creditworthiness including, without limitation, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments, ordering a credit report, or verifying information against third party databases or through other sources. <br /> <br />Additional information is available in our&nbsp;Privacy &amp; Data Policy.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Illegal Activities</strong></span>. You shall ensure that neither you nor any of your affiliates, clients, and/or partners are engaged in money laundering activities or any other illegal activities. You shall comply with Applicable Law, including the laws and regulations of the United States of America and all laws and regulations regarding anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and money transfer, and remittance, and shall abide by the Applicable Law in the jurisdiction where accounts are settled.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Compliance and Risk Management</strong></span><strong> with Money Service Business</strong>. If you are a money service company, you shall establish and maintain anti-money laundering, compliance, and risk management procedures and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, make aforesaid documents to Wyre for its review. Wyre shall have the right to conduct periodic audits in connection to the Transactions. <strong>Such audits, in Wyre</strong><strong>&rsquo;</strong><strong>s sole discretion, may include a review of documents, contracts, hardware and software systems, security systems, policies, procedures, and books and records. Audits may </strong><strong>be conducted by Wyre or its designated representatives with advance notice. In exercising its rights under this paragraph, Wyre and its representatives shall take reasonable measures to avoid disruption of the business of the audited party.</strong> You acknowledge that any changes to the your compliance program might incur incremental risks with respect to the Service and have a negative impact on the result of Wyre&rsquo;s risk assessment of you. You hereby agree in good faith to use commercially reasonable efforts to evaluate and inform Wyre of any changes to the aforesaid documents. You shall cooperate with us and use your best efforts to assist Wyre in identifying, addressing and mitigating any risks, preventing money laundering and investigating suspicious transactions in connection with the Services. In the event that any Governmental Authority requests or otherwise inquires about information in relation to suspicious activities in connection with the Services, you shall promptly provide the relevant details and information to us within seven (7) business days. You shall assume all liabilities arising from its failure to provide information to any Governmental Authority relating to suspicious transactions. You shall comply with Applicable Law in relation to the requirements of storage of Transaction records.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong><strong>.</strong>Pursuant to the economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&ldquo;OFAC&rdquo;), Wyre is prohibited from providing services or entering into relationships with certain individuals and entities. In the event that Wyre is required to block assets associated with your Wyre Account in accordance with an OFAC sanctions program or other similar government sanctions programs, Wyre may (i) deactivate or cancel your Wyre Account or block user activity, (ii) transfer digital currency from your Wyre Account to an originating source or to an account specified by authorities, or (iii) require you to transfer your digital currency out of your Wyre Account within a certain period of time. Wyre is not responsible for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you may incur as a result of our complying with applicable law, the guidance or direction of any regulatory authority or government agency, or any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant or other legal order.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Third Party Conduct</strong></span>. You shall hold Wyre harmless from any delays in the Services or errors in credits into the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank account that are caused by you, the originator or the financial institution.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><strong>Multiple Accounts. </strong>You may register only one Wyre Account (&ldquo;Account&rdquo;). If you open additional accounts, we reserve the right to immediately close such additional accounts and transfer any balance to your other Wyre Account or return it to the original funding source.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><strong>Currency Conversion &amp; Volatility</strong>. When you convert one currency into another currency (such as USD to CNY, CNY to USD, etc.) by completing a deposit or by changing the currency that denominates your account, such currency conversion is completed directly by Wyre. You acknowledge that the price or value of any currency may fluctuate and that the conversion rate (the &ldquo;Conversion Rate&rdquo;) for converting one currency into another may not be the same Conversion Rate that applies when converting back into that first currency. You will always be shown the applicable Conversion Rate for a transaction prior to consummating the transaction. You agree to deliver the agreed upon payment upon confirmation of a deposit, regardless of changes in a currency&rsquo;s value. The value of currencies (especially digital currencies) can rapidly increase or decrease at any time, so Wyre cannot guarantee the value of any currency. The Services do not involve any extension of credit to you, and no credit is extended to you in connection with your use of the Services. In the event you are entitled to a refund or other payment by Wyre, Wyre shall have no liability for any losses resulting from a change in the Conversion Rate that may have occurred since the time of the original transaction. We are not responsible for any processing delays that may result in connection with any deposit, withdrawal, or transaction. The ability to convert from one currency to another is subject to applicable legal and regulatory restrictions as well as the availability of such currency provided by Wyre. <br /> <br />All funds received into your Wyre Account will be delivered in the currency that your account is denominated in, regardless of what currency the transaction is initiated in. For example, if your Wyre Account is denominated in U.S. Dollars and someone sends you Euros or Bitcoin, we will automatically convert such Euros or Bitcoin, as applicable, to U.S. Dollars based upon the current Conversion Rate. We are not responsible for any losses that might be incurred as a result of the Conversion Rate that applies to a given transaction.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wyre</strong><strong> is not a Bank.</strong>We are not a bank, so balances are not deposits and they do not earn interest. Balances are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, or any other entity or insurance scheme, whether governmental or private.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><strong>Fees</strong>. You will incur a percentage-based fee that will be disclosed to you at the time of each Transaction. <br /> <br />We may charge a fee for adding and removing Value to cover applicable bank, wire or other fees. We will display applicable fees for adding or removing Value prior to you completing the transaction. We will not process a transaction if the fee exceeds the value of your transaction. In addition, your bank or card issuer may charge fees for a given transaction.&nbsp;We will display applicable fees for adding or removing Value prior to you completing the transaction.<br /> <br />Your bank may charge you non-sufficient funds ("NSF") or overdraft fees if you do not have sufficient funds to complete a transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance in your Account and sufficient credit limits on your credit cards in order to avoid any overdraft, NSF or similar fees. Any and all NSFs are your sole responsibility. <strong>We reserve the right to report, suspend and/or terminate Accounts for chargeback abuse.<br /><br /></strong></li>
					<li><strong>Right to a Collection Agency</strong>. You understand that if you have an unpaid balance and do not make satisfactory payment arrangements, your account may be placed with an external collection agency. You will be responsible for reimbursements of any fees from the collection agency, including all costs and expenses incurred collecting your account, and possibly including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees if so incurred during collection efforts.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Payment Limit</strong></span>. We shall establish and change certain limits for transactions based on the risk assessment, provided, however, that we shall have the right to establish and change certain reasonable limits for transactions in accordance with laws and regulations.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><strong>Taxes</strong><strong>.</strong>It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions associated with your receipt or transfer of digital currency, and/or to the Currency Transactions you conduct through the Wyre Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Your transaction history is available through your Wyre Account.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><strong>Cancellations</strong><strong>.</strong>If your primary funding source has insufficient Value to cover the amount to be added, we may immediately cancel or reverse the transaction. We may try, but have no obligation to, attempt to fulfill add-Value transaction using an alternative payment method. You agree that we may debit any of your payment methods for the full or partial amount of your add-Value request plus any fees or amounts due us. We may resubmit debits or charges to your add-Value methods until all amounts owed by you to us are satisfied in full.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><strong>Abandoned Property</strong><strong>. To the extent required by law, if you leave a balance unused for the period of time set forth by your state, country, or any&nbsp;other governing body in its unclaimed property laws, if you cancel your Account and leave a balance, or if we deactivate your account and you do not meet any conditions necessary to reinstate it within six (6) months, we may close your account and send your balance to any mailing address you provide using the Service or, if required, escheat (send) your balance to your jurisdiction of residency (based on the jurisdiction associated with that mailing address).<br /><br /></strong></li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Regulatory Suspension or Termination</strong></span>. We may suspend or terminate the Services at any time in connection with any transaction as required by Applicable Law and any Governmental Authority. Such suspension or termination shall not be constituted a breach of this Agreement by Wyre. In accordance with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and practices, we may impose reasonable limitations and controls on the ability of you or any beneficiary to utilize the Services. Such limitations may include where good cause exists, rejecting Transaction Request, freezing funds, or restricting you from using the Services. <br /> <br />Wyre reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Currency Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order. Wyre cannot reverse a Currency Transaction which has been communicated to and confirmed by the Currency network.<br /> <br />Wyre has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party.

Of course, you may not cancel your Account in an effort to avoid paying amounts due us or if your activity is under investigation.<br /> <br />In some cases, we may terminate, suspend or otherwise restrict your Account and use of the Service, including if we receive facially valid legal process&nbsp;if we suspect your Account is connected to any Prohibited Use or Business, for violation of this Agreement or policies or to otherwise prevent loss.

					<li><strong>Disputes</strong><strong>.</strong>We work hard to resolve any disputes we may have through our support team. If we cannot, you and we agree that any dispute arising under or relating to your use of the Service or any action by us affecting your Account, either you or we may choose to resolve the dispute by binding arbitration, instead of in court. Any claim (except for a claim for intellectual property infringement, abuse of the Service by members or the validity or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including the class action waiver) shall be resolved by binding arbitration if either side requests it.<br /> <br />Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought, in an individual capacity only, and not on a class-wide or representative basis, in the courts specified in&nbsp;Section 9 (Entire Agreement)&nbsp;without the posting of a bond), any dispute between you and Wyre related in any way to, or arising in any way from, our Services or this Agreement (&ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;) shall be finally settled on an individual, non-representative basis in binding arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (available from AAA on its website at www.adr.org), as modified by this Agreement, or in accordance with rules on which we may mutually agree; provided, however, that to the extent a Dispute is within the scope of a small claims court&rsquo;s jurisdiction, either you or Wyre may commence an action in small claims court, in the county of your most recent physical address, to resolve the Dispute.<br /> <br />Any arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county of your most recent physical address. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys&rsquo; fees when authorized by law. The arbitral decision may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. An arbitral decision is subject to very limited review by a court. This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce, and therefore, the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;) applies to this Agreement, including the agreement to arbitrate set forth in this Section 6. We each agree that the FAA, and not state law, shall govern whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration.<br /> <br /> <span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>Survival of this Provision</strong></span>. This arbitration provision shall survive; the closing of your account; voluntary payment of your account or any part of it; any legal proceedings to collect money you owe; any bankruptcy by you; and any sale by us of your account. <br /> <br /> <span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>You May Reject Arbitration</strong></span>. You may reject the Arbitration agreement set forth in this Section but only if we receive from you a written notice of rejection within 30 days of your creation of your account. You must send the notification of rejection to&nbsp;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5c2f292c2c332e281c2f3932382b252e39723f3331"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="77040207071805033704121913000e05125914181a">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></a>. Your rejection notice must include your name, address, phone number, registration email, user ID, and personal signature. No one else may sign the rejection notice for you. Your rejection notice also must not be sent with any other correspondence. Rejection of arbitration will not affect your other rights or responsibilities under this Agreement.
